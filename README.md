I made this terrible website indexing service trying to copy googles search engine with a simple crawler and live Database. This technology will be soon patented and will not be developed under MIT Licence so caution! Anyway I learnt actually a ton of stuff about web browsers and http requests than i thought. this project was very fun and exhausting as I decided to make the crawler entirely from Golang instead of python. which couldbe been 50loc max .4/5
